# china_data_csv_to_json
#python3
Takes registered entry csv and turns it into full html for the website

The file expects "repoffinput.csv" to be in the same directory.  That file should be structured in the way the chinefile data is structured as of 12/28/17.

If the data structure changes it could be as easy as editing the numbers in the "for row in exampleData" section in order to point it in the right direction
